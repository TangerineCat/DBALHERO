knapsack algorithm
Version Alpha 1.1

Currently weight is equal to value.

knapsack is the main algorithm library. Coin is an example implementation of
the knapsack algorithm.

Things to be added:
Separate value from cost: maximize value instead of cost, i.e. make the paper bag worth very little, but ok for filling

implement ways to read in properties to display

Implement QT gui? or go for web dev
